# fromJalaToScalaExceptionHandling
Stop writing exception handling in Jala and start writing in functional scala

This was created to give examples of how use various error handling techniques in scala.

The import parts were developed in TDD. You can use the Tests as documentation for each part of the production code.

The examples in this repo are trivial. So trivial in fact that you might find yourself asking, "Why would you write code like this?".
Well the simple answer is, you mostly wouldn't. The point is just to show you how use the tools.
