# fromJalaToScalaExceptionHandling
Stop writing exception handling in Jala and start writing in functional scala

This was created to give examples of how use various error handling techniques in scala.

The tests are the example usages. You should be able to read the tests to decide which is the best way to go. If something isn't 
clear enough please open an issue for me.

The examples in this repo are trivial. So trivial in fact that you might find yourself asking, "Why would you write code like this?".
Well the simple answer is, you mostly wouldn't. The point is just to show you how use the tools.
